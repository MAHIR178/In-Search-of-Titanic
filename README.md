# In-Search-of-Titanic
This is a computer graphics project created as part of the Computer Graphics course . The project takes users on a visually immersive journey through three captivating scenarios:

Scenarios:

Setting Sail:

Begin the adventure at the dock under a vibrant summer sky, complete with clouds and a shining sun. The submarine starts its journey into the unknown.

Into the Depths:

The submarine dives deeper into the ocean, exploring the mysterious, dimly lit underwater world. Schools of fish swim around, adding life to the hauntingly dark sea.

Discovering the Titanic:

At the ocean floor, the submarine discovers the remains of the sunken Titanic. The scene is eerily dark, with sharks circling the wreckage.

Features:

Dynamic Environments: Transition between bright, sunny skies and the dark, mysterious ocean depths.

Realistic Animations: Submarine movement, swaying fish, and oceanic elements bring the scenes to life.

Interactive Visuals: A blend of polygon rendering, shading, and blending techniques to enhance realism.


Technologies Used:

OpenGL: For rendering 2D and 3D graphics.

C++: For logic and implementation of the visual elements.
