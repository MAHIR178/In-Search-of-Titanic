# In-Search-of-Titanic
This is a computer graphics project created as part of the Computer Graphics course (Section H). The project takes users on a visually immersive journey through three captivating scenarios:
Scenarios:
Setting Sail:
Begin the adventure at the dock under a vibrant summer sky, complete with clouds and a shining sun. The submarine starts its journey into the unknown.
Into the Depths:
The submarine dives deeper into the ocean, exploring the mysterious, dimly lit underwater world. Schools of fish swim around, adding life to the hauntingly dark sea.
Discovering the Titanic:
At the ocean floor, the submarine discovers the remains of the sunken Titanic. The scene is eerily dark, with sharks circling the wreckage.
Features:
Dynamic Environments: Transition between bright, sunny skies and the dark, mysterious ocean depths.
Realistic Animations: Submarine movement, swaying fish, and oceanic elements bring the scenes to life.
Interactive Visuals: A blend of polygon rendering, shading, and blending techniques to enhance realism.
Technologies Used:
OpenGL: For rendering 2D and 3D graphics.
C++: For logic and implementation of the visual elements.
